# STUDENT ID # 816029229

## HOW TO INSTALL & PLAY:
Download the repository, unzip the files, open the unzipped folder in vscode or any other IDE you prefer, locate the GameApplication.java file and run it.

## GAME CONCEPT: 
In Cave Diver, you play as a scuba diver on the search for lost treasure. During this search you must collect as much gold coins as possible and locate the hidden 
treasure, all while being chased by a shark. After discovering the hidden treasure you must make your way back to you submarine, however there are several enemies in your path that you must either avoid or defeat. 

## CONTROLS:
W or Up Arrow Key to move up  
S or Down Arrow Key to move down  
A or Left Arrow Key to move left  
D or Right Arrow Key to move right  
Space Bar to shoot harpoon spear (only in level 2)

## HOW TO WIN: 
In level 1, collect as much gold coins as you can and make it to the hidden treasure with at least 1 life remaining. In level 2, you must either defeat the enemies in your path by shooting them with the harpoon spears or avoiding them and making it to the submarine with at least 1 life remaining.  

## HOW TO LOSE: 
On either level 1 or 2, you can only lose by having your 3 lives taken away. One life is taken away each time you are attacked by a shark. 

## HOW TO SCORE POINTS: 
In level 1, there are gold coins scattered around the ocean cave that increases the players score by 5 points per coin collected.  Finding the hidden treasure chest also increases the players score by 10 points. In level 2, every jellyfish killed increases the players score by 3 points and every shark killed increases the players score by 5 points. 

## HOW TO LOSE POINTS: 
Being bitten by a shark decreases the players score by 3 points and being stung by a jellyfish removes 2 points from the players’ score. 

## SPECIAL EFFECTS: 
### Level 1: 
• Every 20 seconds that passes, the shark chasing the player speeds up.  
• If the shark bites the player, they lose 3 points from their score along with 1 life and the shark gets slightly faster. 
• If the shark eats a jellyfish, it becomes slower and is distracted (stops chasing the player) for 10 seconds.  
• If the player is stung by a jellyfish, they lose 2 points from their score. 
• After being bitten by a shark or stung by a jellyfish, there is a 5 second grace period where the player cannot be injured. 
• Interacting with the hidden treasure chest progresses the game onto the next level. 

### Level 2: 
• Every 20 seconds that passes, the shark chasing the player speeds up.  
• If the shark bites the player, they lose 3 points from their score along with 1 life and the shark gets slightly faster. 
• If the shark eats a jellyfish, it becomes slower and is distracted (stops chasing the player) for 10 seconds.  
• If the player is stung by a jellyfish, they lose 2 points from their score. 
• After being bitten by a shark or stung by a jellyfish, there is a 5 second grace period where the player cannot be injured. 
• Pressing space bar fires a harpoon spear from the player.
